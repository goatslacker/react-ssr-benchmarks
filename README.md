# react-ssr-benchmarks

The purpose of this repo is to host runnable benchmarks of React's server-side rendering across
different versions.

I've browserified React into different bundles which exist in [the react/ folder](react/).

The benchmarks are ran with `NODE_ENV=production` so that checks and warnings are skipped.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run bench`.
